## Advantage

- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla
- Multi-platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows

## How it works?

With the help of built-in way of datapack since 1.13, we realized the feature by writing a datapack with function files in it.

## How can I choose which to download?

1. Check your Minecraft game version, and choose the version.
2. Choose light or extra version:
   the light version only support really basic features comparing to the extra version,
   the effect is just like using a /tp command, players will be instantly teleported when a request was sent. 
   while the extra version contains more features like going back to the last position like /back in some plugins. 

## How to install?

1. Download datapack file according to your need, see above if you're not sure.
2. Upzip the datapack file.
3. Put it in the folder. (The paths: "/world/datapacks/" for server, ".minecraft/saves/(Your world name)/datapacks" for LAN players)
4. Do /reload in game.

## How to use?

For detail, go [wiki](https://github.com/Xiao-tu233/Minecraft-TPA-Datapack/wiki)

## Features

1. Use /trigger tpa to sent your tpa request and opt options.
2. Modify back, always-accept, language and idfix in tpa menu. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
3. For operators, use /function tpa:options to change the configs. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
4. If you meet the problem, which there're 2 players who were given a same player id, you can try id fix in tpa menu. Id fix will reset all the ids of players.
5. If you don't know someone's id who you've already known his name, use search id in tpa menu. ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
6. If you want to go back to where you were teleported from, use /trigger back. ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
7. If you think the sound is annoying, find mute datapack in tpa menu. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
8. To look up more players' ids, click "...more". ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
9. If you want someone to be where you're, Use /trigger tpahere. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
10. If you are using a language the datapack doesn't support, you can modify it in the langtell file folder. In fact, to avoid that great work of who using datapack, we are planning to make a add-on for it to make sure everyone can use the datapack with their language! (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
