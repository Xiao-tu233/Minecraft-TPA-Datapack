## Advantage

- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla
- Multi-platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows

## How it works?

With the help of built-in way of datapack since 1.13, we realized the feature by writing a datapack with function files in it.

## How can I choose which to download?

1. ensure your Minecraft game version. If your game version isn't fit the datapack version you installed, it may cause a lot of problems.
2. choose light version or extra version. The light version only has simplified Chinese and decreased some functions comparing to extra versions. As a comparation, the extra version is more suitable for mega server owners and the users who don't speak simplified Chinese.
3. And also, in light versions, everyone will accept every tpa requests no matter who the requester is.

## How to install?

Go to [Tutorial of installing datapacks](https://zh.minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E5%8C%85).

## How to use?

1. Use /trigger tpa to sent your tpa request and opt options.
2. Modify back, always-accept, language and idfix in tpa menu. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
3. For operators, use /function tpa:options to change the configs. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
4. If you meet the problem, which there're 2 players who were given a same player id, you can try id fix in tpa menu. Id fix will reset all the ids of players.
5. If you don't know someone's id who you've already known his name, use search id in tpa menu. ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
6. If you want to go back to where you were teleported from, use /trigger back. ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
7. If you think the sound is annoying, find mute datapack in tpa menu. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
8. To look up more players' ids, click "...more". ( EXTRA VERSION & GAME VERSION >= 1.20.2 ONLY)
9. If you want someone to be where you're, Use /trigger tpahere. (EXTRA VERISION ONLY)
10. If you are using a language the datapack doesn't support, you can modify it in the langtell file folder. In fact, to avoid that great work of who using datapack, we are planning to make a add-on for it to make sure everyone can use the datapack with their language!
